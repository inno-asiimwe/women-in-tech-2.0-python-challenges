# Day two
Welcome to the second day of the third week of the program. Today's challenges will require the some knowledge of lists and conditional logic. 

## Programming challenge:
### FIZZBUZZ
Write a function named fizzbuzz that takes two(2) lists  and returns Fizz if the combined length of the lists is divisible by 3,  Buzz if it is divisible by 5, Fizzbuzz if it is divisible by both 5 and 3, otherwise returns the combined length of the lists.
For example:
- fizzbuzz([1, 2, 3], [ ])    # will return “fizz”
- fizzbuzz([1, 2, 3], [1, 2])  # will return “buzz”  
- fizzbuzz([1, 2, 3], [1]) # will return 4 

In the fizzbuzz folder there is fizzbuzz.py and fizzbuzz_test.py, implement the fizzbuzz function in fizzbuzz.py, the implementation should pass all the tests in fizzbuzz_test.py. The goal is to write clean readable code that implements fizzbuzz and passes all the tests.
Feel free to add more tests.

### More instructions
Create a new repository and copy the files from the fizzbuzz folder to your own repository and follow git best practices while completing the challenge. Share a link to your remote respository with your Learning Facilitator for review.
