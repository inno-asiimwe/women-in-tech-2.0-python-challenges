# Day five
It is exciting to see that you have come all the way to the last day of week three, and we happy to have you here.
Our forecast today is Object Oriented programming and reflecting on our journeys so far.
You are expected to write a blog post and solve the bank account coding challenge.

## Medium Blog Post
It has been a whole week of learning new programming concepts using the Python programming language. Write a blog post about the Python programming language and a thing or two that stands out for you about Python. The blog post does not necessarily need to be technical but it can be technical if you so wish, for example it can be a short tutorial on a concept you have learnt or how you solved one of the programming challenges this week.


## Coding challenge 
### Bank account
Simulate a bank account supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits
of money. Ignore the possibility of concurrent transactions!

A bank account can be accessed in multiple ways. Clients can make
deposits and withdrawals using the internet, mobile phones, etc. Shops
can charge against the account.

It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed
account must fail.


The BankAccount folder contains two files, account.py and test_account.py.
In account.py there is a skeleton of the bankAccount class with unimplemented methods and in tests.py there are tests for the methods in the bankAccount class. Challenge today is to implement the methods of the bankAccount class and make all tests pass. Passing the tests is the first step, but goal is to have clean readable code that solves the problem and passes all the tests. Feel free to add more methods and tests.

#### Raising Exceptions
At times it is important to raise exceptions. These come in handy for debugging purposes. This challenge will require you to raise exceptions for operations that should fail.

Note: Create a new repository for the challenge copy over the files from the BankAccount folder to your new repository and happy coding. Ensure you have a detailed readme in the repository.

## Next steps
This challenge introduces you to classes and methods, which is just the beginning of OOP. Go ahead review and practice other OOP concepts, including but not limited to Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Overloading.
