# women-in-tech-2.0-python-challenges

## Week three 
This week focusses on Python, programming principles, programming logic, Object Oriented Programming, Test Driven Development and writing professionally.

### Prerequisites
- Github account(github.com).
- Medium account(medium.com).
- Python 3 installed on your computer.
- A code editor (vs code).
- Have gone through the andela home study curriculum.

### Recommended reference material:
- https://github.andela.com/homestudy/ (Andela Homestudy curriculum)
- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/
- https://pythonspot.com/
- https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learning-to-test-with-python-997ace2d8abe

### The Challenges
There are two types of challenges the blog posts which are meant to encourage your write professionally and the coding challenges which are meant to encourage learn python and improvr your programming logic.
Please note that this is a public repository which means anyone can access the challenges. You are highly encouraged to attempt the challenges yourself as they prepare you for the final project which will be shared later in the program.

Please note that the purpose of the challenges is not to eliminate you from the program but help you learn and prepare you for the projects yet to come.

### The medium blog posts 
As a programmer you will have to write atleast once in a while so as to share knowledge or communicate. As far as communication is concerned it should be effective and professional. Aim of the blog posts is to encourage you write professionally for both technical and non-technical audiences. You are highly encouraged to research and reflect before writing. While writing watchout for grammartical and spelling errors.

### The coding challenges:
You will be required to submit a solution to a coding challenge daily. Solve each challenge in a new repository and share the link of your online repository with your Learning Facilitator at the end of the day for review.

The challenges will introduce a concept or two, after solving the challenge it is advisable that you explore the concept deeper for a better understanding. 

For most of the challenges minimum tests are written for you, ensure that you code makes all tests pass and feel free to add more tests. 

Make sure your code is clean and readable code. 

### Moving forward
Continue learning and growing. ```Happy coding!!```
