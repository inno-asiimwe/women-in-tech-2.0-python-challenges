# Day three
On this third day of the third week focus will be on understanding data structures and algorithms therefore we shall write a blog post and solve a coding challenge in the same.


## Medium Blog Post
One of the most important areas in computing and software engineering is Algorithms and data structures. As programmers we use these concepts in our day to day work. Write a blog post sharing your understanding of algorithms and scenarios where you have used data structures or would use data structures. (assume you have both technical and non-technical readers.)

## Coding Challenge
### Sorting:
Given a list containing integers and one character strings, write a function that takes a list and returns a dictionary with keys evens, odds, and chars. The value for evens is a list of sorted even numbers, the value for odds is a list of sorted odd numbers and chars is a list of sorted character strings.  
`list_sort([2,0,6,5,1,7,’z’,’a’])   # returns {‘evens’: [0,2,6], odds: [1,5,7], chars:[‘a’,’z’]}`

### Instructions:
In the listsort folder there are two files list_sort.py and list_sort_test.py, list_sort_test.py includes minimal tests for the challenge, implement list_sort() in list_sort.py to pass all the tests. Feel free to write more tests.

Create a new repository for the solution and copy over the challenge files to the new repository. You are expected to use version control and share a link to the remote repository  with your Learning facilitator for review. 

Expectation: Clean readable code that solves the challenge and passes all the tests.
