# Day one
Welcome to week three of the program, congratulations on having made it this far and thank you for not giving up.
Today's challenges include writing a blog post and solving coding challenges.


## Blog Post
Write a medium blog post as to why you are learning programming and whether it is a worthy venture. (at least 3 min read)


## Coding challenge one 
Write a python program that prompts a user to enter their year of birth and in return prints a string in the console stating whether the user  is a minor, a youth or an elder. Anyone below 18 years is a minor, anyone between , 18 and 36 years of age is a youth and the rest are elders.

## Coding challenge two
Write a python program that returns a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 15 and the values are squares of the keys. Please note that do not hard code the dictionary and TTD is optional but highly encouraged.

### Submission instructions
For every coding challenge create a new repository from where you solve the challenge, share a link to the remote repository(github) with your learning Facilitator for review.
Make sure you have clean readable code that solves the challenge before submission and feel free to write unit tests for your solution.
``` Happy coding!!!```
