# Day four
On the second last day of week three, We `own our own tests` as we learn about recursion.

By the way, a recursive function is a function that calls itself. So, what is recursion? and how many different types of recursion do you know about?

## Coding Challenge:
There are two challenges today, expectation is that you solve atleast one of them using recursion and following a Test Driven Development approach. 

### Challenge one:
Write a python program that sums items in a list, the list can contain integers and lists of integers.
for example
 ``` 
 input: [ 1, 2, [3, 4]]
 output: 10 
```
### Challenge two:
Power(a, b) is a function that calculates the mathematical ‘a’ raised to a power ‘b’. Using recursion provide  a python implementation of the power(a,b) function. 
For example:
```
power(3, 4)  # returns 81 which is (3 * 3 * 3 * 3)
power(2, 3) # returns 8 which is (2 * 2 * 2 )
```
### More Instructions:
- Attempt atleast one challenge, doing both challenges is highly advisable.
- First write unit tests before implementing the solutions.
- Have a fresh repository for each of the challenges and share links with your Learning Facilitator for review.
- Aim is to write clean readable code that passes all the tests and solves the challenge.
